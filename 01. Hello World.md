# Hello World!

As my first step along documenting the process I follow, it felt appropriate to start where everything starts, 
with **"Hello World"**.

To briefly introduce myself, my name is Ollie and at the time of writing, I am a Data analyst at Public Health Scotland. Before that I was a Data Analyst at NHS Digital. I started my higher education studying Ancient and Medieval History, despite my interest in history however, studying it at university proved to be a step too far for me. Nonetheless, I made it to the end of my degree and instead found that numbers and problem solving were where my skills and passion truly lay, as I embarked then on a Master's Degree in Data Science. 

Coming out of university, I did not immediately feel that I was ready to take on a job in Data Science. While the Master's had given me a good foundation, I wanted to get some workplace experience working with data, hence for the last 2 and a half years, I have worked as a Data Analyst. It would be fair to say that for that time I have relaxed into that role as an Analyst as it was comfortable, the pay was  good enough and I was working with data, but from the start of this year (2023), the fire in me has once again been lit, I feel ready to start embracing Data Science problems, and have the drive to do so. Which brings us to now.

I wanted to start applying for jobs (perhaps a little prematurely), so I decided to start by looking at how I might create a portfolio of my experience and the projects I have already done. Naturally I sought out guidance online. Most guidance presented me with examples of finished portfolios made my people significantly further along in their Data Science journey than I am. With these I found it difficult to fully plot the path to this level, but also got the feeling that I didn't even have enough to get started. I wanted to know a process I could follow so that I knew I could tick things off as I go until I reached that seemingly super advanced position. While I was searching for advice, recurring themes were; to have an online presence, use GitHub and write blogs. I wondered how I could write blogs on anything Data Science while I am still so relatively new to it, especially because all the blogs I've come across are written by people who come across as so much more experienced and obviously know a lot more than I do.

So I thought, why not write a blog documenting *my* process, while I'm going through it. The process will be raw and imperfect. I will make mistakes, I'll have to backtrack, but over time, I will move towards the levels of those Data Scientists I've come across. This way, I hope that anyone who finds themself in a similar position to my own can take reference from what I've done, and they will see that it is okay to make mistakes, and that they don't immediately have to be perfect Data Scientists.

This is quite a scary thing for me, I have a lot of anxiety over writing things that (I hope) someone will read, particularly something like this where I will feel vulnerable, openly making mistakes. I'm sure though that by writing alongside my Data Science devlopment, as my skills and knowledge in Data Science improve, as will my ability to write and I'll be writing high level blogs and reports in no time. In time I would like to make this blog somewhat more professional, but for the time being, that is above my capabilities, so for the time being I will progress with GitHub, but keep you eyes peeled for the Data Science Journey appearing on Medium, or even maybe having it's own site.

As well as documenting everything I do, I'd really like for this blog to help me in my advancement, so please do engage with it! Head over to discussions where I'm happy to receive any questions, feedback, advice or any comments you want to make.

I'll leave it there for now. This is just an introduction to myself and this blog. Over the next couple of weeks I'll detail what I've done up to this point in my Data Science journey, how I prepared for the Master's, the Master's itself and what I've done in the last few weeks to get the journey restarted.
