# Hello World!

As my first along documenting the process I follow, it felt appropriate to start where everything starts, 
with "Hello World".

To briefly introduce myself, my name is Ollie and at the time of writing, I am a Data analyst at Public 
Health Scotland. Before that I was a Data Analyst at NHS Digital. I started my higher education studying 
Ancient and Medieval History, despite my interest in history however, studying it at university proved 
to be a step too far for me. Nonetheless, I made it to the end of my degree and instead found that numbers
and problem solving were where my skills and passion truly lay, as I embarked then on a Master's Degree in 
Data Science. 

Coming out of university, I did not immediately feel that I was ready to take on a job in
Data Science. While the Master's had given me a good foundation, I wanted to get some workplace experience
working with data, hence for the last 2 and a half years, I have worked as a Data Analyst. It would be fair
to say that for that time I have relaxed into that role as an Analyst as it was comfortable, the pay was 
good enough and I was working with data, but from the start of the year, the fire in me has once again been
lit, I feel ready to start embracing Data Science problems, and have the drive to do so. Which brings us to
now.
